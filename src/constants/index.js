export const aboutChaughadiyaText = "According to indian Vedic Astrology, Chaughadia Muhurtas are a quick and effective method to find out the intraday auspicious times to start a new venture / project or begin an important / auspicious work. These muhurtas are extensively used in India. In this method, 24 hours of a day are divided into 16 time segments of approximately one and a half hours each (i.e., approx. 3.75 Ghati). Each of these time segments is called a Chaughadia due to its approximate duration of 3.75 Ghati. These Chawghariya / chaughadias are of 7 types and are either good or bad or medium (neutral) in nature. To begin any good work, only  Good Chaughadias are selected. It is believed that that if a work is started in  Good Chaughadia and other Muhurta determining factors (such as Tithi, Nakshatra, Yoga etc.) are also favourable, success is almost assured in one's efforts.";
